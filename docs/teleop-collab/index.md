# Collaborating on robot code

We will be working together to make robot teleop code with most of the features from last year's competition robot.

## Instructions

Open `Git Bash`. See [Setup Instructions](../setup#install-git) if you haven't installed Git yet.

Type `cd Documents` and press Enter. Then type `git clone https://github.com/seamonsters-2605/practice-teleop`

> You have just "cloned" a "repository" from GitHub. A repository holds code that multiple people can collaborate on. You now have a new folder in your Documents folder called "practice-teleop" which contains this code. You will be able to add your own code and upload it so that everybody else can get your changes (sort of like collaborating on a document with Google Docs).

Type `git checkout -b your-name`. Use your own name instead of `your-name`. Make sure there are no spaces or capital letters. Use `-` to separate words.

This created a new "branch." While everybody is working on their own changes to the code, this means you can make your changes without them interfering with other people's changes.

There is a robot.py file in here which we will all be editing. Each person/group will be assigned one (or more) of these tasks. Click the link to see more information.
