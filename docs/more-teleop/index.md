# More teleop programming practice

Try making some improvements to your [first robot program](../first-program). It will be easiest to test your program in the robot simulator. Read [this](../robot-sim) page for instructions on setting up the simulator.

Here are some ideas for changes to make. Look at the [Robot Programming Reference](../reference) for help.

- Notice that when you push both joysticks forward, the wheels move in opposite directions. Fix this so the wheels move in the same direction.
- Tank Drive is easy to program but hard to drive. Try rewriting your code so it only needs a single joystick&mdash;move it up and down to drive forwards and backwards, and left and right to turn.
- Add a button to the joystick that activates a *slow mode*.
- Add a button to the joystick which reverses the driving direction.
- Add a shake button. Hold the button to shake the robot.
- Add strafing (sideways movement). The mecanum wheels on the robot allow it to move sideways&mdash;try [this simulator](../../sketches/mecanum) to see how it works.
