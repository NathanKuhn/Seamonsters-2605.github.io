# More teleop programming practice

Try making some improvements to your [first robot program](../first-program). It will be easiest to test your program in the robot simulator. Read [this](../robot-sim) page for instructions on setting up the simulator.

Here are some ideas for changes to make. Look at the [Robot Programming Reference](../reference) for help.

- The robot is very fast. Slow down the maximum speed.
- Add a button to the joystick that activates a *fast mode*.
- Add a button for a *slow mode*.
- Add a button to the joystick which reverses the driving direction.
