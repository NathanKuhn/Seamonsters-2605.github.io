        <h1> Learning Python and Git </h1>
        
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"> Codecademy</a>: there are good tutorials on here for Python and Git. The Git tutorial is quick and easy to follow. The Python tutorial is a bit longer (you can skip Units 9 and 10 and stop after 11). It may be slow for you if you have already done some programming in another language&mdash;in that case, you should try the python.org tutorial below. </li>
            <li> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" target="_blank"> The Python Tutorial</a>: This is recommended if you already know the basic concepts of programming, or you need to refresh yourself on Python syntax. Make sure you look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html">Part 9 (Classes)</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Make sure you understand object oriented programming concepts (classes, objects…). Some tutorials don’t cover these but they are important to know. Both of the tutorials above have information.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Remember to also practice the things you are learning outside of the lessons and tutorials! Make something interesting in Python (not necessarily for robotics) and post it on GitHub! If you have questions you can ask them in the #controlsystems Slack channel.
