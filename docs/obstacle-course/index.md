# Obstacle Course

**Challenge:** Make a robot navigate a virtual obstacle course autonomously.

Open Command Prompt and clone the Obstacle Course repository by typing:

```
cd Documents
git clone https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/practice-teleop
```

There will be a folder in your Documents folder called `practice-teleop`. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code. In the VS Code Terminal, run the command `python robot.py sim`. You will see the robot simulator with an obstacle course. You can click the "Autonomous" button to run the robot (nothing will happen right now because there is no robot code).

You will need to edit `robot.py` to make the robot navigate the course without touching any green walls, and end in the yellow box. You can use the [Robot Programming Reference](../reference/) page as a reference.
