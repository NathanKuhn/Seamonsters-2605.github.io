        This is a work in progress.

        <h1> Using the Seamonsters Library </h1>
        <p>
            The Seamonsters Python library is a collection of useful code for programming robots, based on what we wrote last year. This includes utilities for getting input from joysticks and gamepads, driving with different types of drivetrains, and simulating the robot on your computer without an actual robot, as well as tools to help organize robot code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently the library is kept in the SeamonstersTemplate repository. The code is <a href="https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/SeamonstersTemplate">here</a>, and the documentation is <a href="https://rawgit.com/Seamonsters-2605/SeamonstersTemplate/master/seamonsters/docs/_build/html/index.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to use it, you will fork the SeamonstersTemplate repository. This lets you have your own copy of the repository on your own account, where you can make whatever changes you want, and still be able to get updates to the library. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/SeamonstersTemplate">library on GitHub</a> and click "Fork" in the top-right corner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you can clone your own fork of the repository to your computer. Open Git Bash (or a Terminal on Mac/Linux) and type:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>cd Documents <br>
            git clone https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/SeamonstersTemplate.git</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            You will now have a folder in your Documents folder called “SeamonstersTemplate.” This has the Seamonsters code library in the “seamonsters” folder. To use this library, you just need to have your robot file in the SeamonstersTemplate folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will add more to this document later.
