    <h1>ARDROID Help</h1>

    <h2>Building the robot</h2>

    <p>The ARDROID app is designed to connect to an <strong><a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-101" target="_blank">Arduino101</a></strong> board with the <strong><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438" target="_blank">Adafruit Motor Shield V2</a></strong>. The Arduino needs a special sketch installed on it&mdash;see the <a href="https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/Ardroid/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Ardroid GitHub repository</a> for instructions on how to install this sketch. The <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/" target="_blank">Adafruit website</a> has instructions on wiring a motor shield&mdash;multiple stacked motor shields are supported to provide extra motors.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1674749" target="_blank">Here is a simple example robot on Thingiverse.</a></p>

    <h2> Controlling the robot</h2>

    <p>On the main screen of the app, tap <code>Bot Settings</code> to configure robot settings, like the driving speed and where the motors are plugged in. You must do this before connecting to the robot. The Bot Settings screen has "What's this?" buttons to explain settings in more detail.</p>

    <p><strong>Motor numbers:</strong> Each Adafruit v2 motor shield has 4 ports for DC motors, numbered 1 through 4. Stepper motors are numbered 1 and 2, and take up 2 ports each&mdash;stepper #1 uses DC ports 1 and 2, and stepper #2 uses DC ports 3 and 4. If you have multiple stacked motor shields, the second sheild has DC motor numbers 5 - 8 and stepper motor numbers 3 - 4, and so on.</p>
    <p>To connect to the robot, turn on Bluetooth on your phone and press "Scan for Bots". Bluetooth devices will show up in a list below. Look for devices with ARDROID in the name. Tap to connect.</p>
    <p>Connecting to the robot will open the control screen. The black dot is a joystick, and you can move it to drive the robot (you must have configured the driving motor ports first). You can also tap the "Tilt" box to allow you to drive the robot by tilting your phone&mdash;hold it level to stop moving, and tilt it in any direction to move the joystick in that direction. To stop all motors from moving, tap "All Off".</p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h3>The robot doesn't appear in the devices list</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Make sure that Bluetooth is turned on for your phone, and that your phone supports BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Android 4.3 or above is required for BLE.</li>
        <li> Make sure the robot is on (the green LED on the motor shield should be on).</li>
        <li> Even if the light is on, the Arduino may be low on battery power.</li>
        <li> Make sure that the latest version of the Ardroid sketch (from <a href="https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/Ardroid/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">this</a> page) is correctly loaded on the Arduino.</li>
        <li> Make sure the Arduino has the correct firmware (see <a href="https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/Ardroid/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">these instructions</a> for details).</li>
        <li> Turn the robot off (unplug the power), wait 5-10 seconds, and turn it on again. This should reset the Bluetooth connection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The app gets stuck while connecting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Wait about 15 seconds. Connecting could take some time especially if you have a lot of stepper motors. </li>
        <li> Press Cancel and try again.</li>
        <li> If there are a lot of Bluetooth devices nearby, make sure they all appear in the list before you choose one.</li>
        <li> Try some of the other steps listed above under "The robot doesn't appear in the devices list".</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The robot doesn't move when you move the joystick</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Check that the motor ports are set to the correct values in Bot Settings.</li>
        <li> Check the connections between the motor shield and the motors.</li>
        <li> Make sure you connected to the robot and not some other bluetooth device. The device in the list should have "ARDROID" in its name.</li>
        <li> Try some of the other steps listed above under "The robot doesn't appear in the devices list".</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The robot stops responding while you are driving it</h3>
    <p> The Arduino is probably running low on battery power. </p>

    <h3>Tilt control doesn't work ("no orientation sensor availible")</h3>
    <p> Some phones don't support tilt control. </p>
