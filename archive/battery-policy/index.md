# Battery Policy

Test a battery with the Battery Beak to see how much it is charged. A battery is considered charged when the "V2" number is around 13 or 12.9V; the charge percentage should be 127% or 130%.

The battery you want charged first should be put on Charger #1, the next on #2 and so on...

1. Speed charger: **This charger needs to be set to 6 amps every time.**
    - Plug the battery in and it will start charging immediately
    - When this charger stops charging the battery because it says it's done, it's wrong&mdash;unplug it and plug it back in. The next time it says it's finished, unplug it and plug it back in&mdash;keep doing this until the battery is actually charged.
2. Smart charger: **For this charger you have to press Charge to make it start.**
    - This charger is the best one we have, and should be used to give a good charge.
    - It should be set to 12V, AGM, and 6 or 10 amps
        - 6 amps is good when you are not in a rush to change the batteries
        - 10 amps is if you are at a competition, or sometimes it's good to help "burn" off sulphate that builds up, but that's only needed if the battery isn't working right&mdash;if won't charge fully or hold a charge.
3. "Three" plug charger: **Only 2 plugs work on this charger.**
    - This one charges slowly. Only use this charger if the other chargers are being used and you need to charge another battery.


### Everyday:

When the meeting starts the Battery Person will check the batteries in the uncharged/used  section and begin charging with the least charged first. As the batteries get charged they will be moved into the charged section. At the end of the day **all chargers MUST be unplugged** before the room is closed.
